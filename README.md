# 180-Day C++ Programming Challenge

Welcome to my 180-day programming challenge repository focused on C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and File Handling!

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my journey of learning and improving my skills in C++ programming, specifically focusing on various aspects such as data structures, algorithms, OOP principles, and file handling.

## Timeline
This repository is structured to cover a 180-day journey. Each day, I will be committing code, learning resources, progress updates, or insights gained during my study and practice.

## Topics Covered
### 1. C++ Basics
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Structures: Loops and Conditionals
- Functions and Scope
- Pointers and References
- Input/Output (I/O) Streams

### 2. Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### 3. Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, etc.)

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- Constructors and Destructors
- Operator Overloading

### 5. File Handling
- Reading and Writing Files
- File Streams and Buffers
- Error Handling and Exceptions
